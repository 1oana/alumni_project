    <h1>Alumni Project Dashboard</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard contains information about the data collected and analysed
      as part of the alumni project. I have grouped plots and summaries by theme
      which you can access using the dropdowns (hopefully)!
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Data collection summary</h2>
    <p>
      Because part of the project is to collect and clean data, I'll start by demonstrating
      the progress made in the data collection. 
    </p>

    <h3>What is the structure of the data?</h3>
    <p>
      The data is stored in an Excel spreadsheet. There are three areas of data collection:
        <ul>
            <li>Alumni information: each student is assigned a unique identifier. 
                Their course, prior institutions and current location are listed.</li>
            <li>Alumni jobs: for each alumnus, this records (where known) each job they 
                have held since leaving the DTC, including employer, title, start and end dates and location.</li>
            <li>Alumni publications: for each alumnus, this records all publications we've been able
                to find that they have published. This records title, authors, journal, year and DOI.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Alumni info progress</h3>
    <p>
      The following plots show the progress made in data collection. The first plot shows the number of students
      for which we have collected alumni information, jobs and publications. The second plot shows the number of
      publications collected.

    <h2>Student info: what happened pre-DTC?</h2>
    <h3>Where did they come from?</h3>
    <p>
      The following plots shows the distribution of where students were before
      they came to the DTC. We can look at country and intitution of both the
      undergraduate and postgraduate study, as well as whether students remained
      where they started.

    <h3>What did they study?</h3>
    <p>
      The following plots shows the distribution of what students studied before
      they came to the DTC. We can look at the subject of both the undergraduate
      and postgraduate study. Subjects were grouped by 'Category' which is a
      broad grouping of subjects. For example, 'Mathematics', 'Applied
      Mathematics' and 'Statistics' etc. are grouped under 'Mathematics'.

    <h2>Graduate info: what are they doing now?</h2>

    <h3>Where are they now?</h3>
    <p>
      The following plots shows the distribution of where students are now. We
      can look at country and intitution of both the undergraduate and
      postgraduate study.

        Firstly, on the top level, we can look at what continents graduates have
        found themselves in.
      </p>
      <img src="../figures/continent_pie.png" alt="Continent" />
      <p>
        The overwhelming majority are (perhaps predictably) in Europe, with
        North America far behind in second place. Let's break that down by
        country.
      </p>
      <img src="../figures/country_pie.png" alt="Country" />
      <p>
        Unsurprisingly, the UK is the most popular destination. The pie chart
        also shows that the overwhelming majority of students in North America
        are in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can take a quick look at where graduates have gone outside of the UK
        in Europe.
      </p>
      <img src="../figures/europe_nouk_country_pie.png" alt="Europe" />
      <p>
        Germany is the most popular destination, with Switzerland and Holland
        following behind.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, we can look at where graduates have gone in the UK.</p>
      <img src="../figures/uk_city_pie.png" alt="UK" />
    </div>

    We can also look at whether graduates remained in the same country as that
    which they studied in prior to the DTC.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Same country?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <img src="../figures/country_change_pie.png" alt="Country Change" />
      <p>
        Most graduates have remained in the same country as that which they
        studied in prior to the DTC.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />

    <h3>What are they doing?</h3>
    <p>
      The following plot shows the distribution of graduates' current sector.
    </p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Job Title & Sector</button>
    <div class="content">
      <img src="../figures/sector_pie.png" alt="Sector" />
      <p>
        Most graduates are in the 'Academic' sector, with 'Research' and
        'Pharma' following behind.
